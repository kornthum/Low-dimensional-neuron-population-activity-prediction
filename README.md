# Low-dimensional-population-activity-prediction

**Topic:** Low dimensional population activity prediction from preparatory neuron to initiation neuron 
in motor cortex

This is one of my projects from the NMA-Deep learning course together with an international team.

------------------

2 Key Question

- Can we use the preparatory neurons’ responses to predict initiation neurons’ response?
- 
- Can the lower dimensional representation of preparatory neuron response imporve the prediction performance?

**From motor planing to Execution in Motor Cortex**
